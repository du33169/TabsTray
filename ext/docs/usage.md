# Welcome to Tabs Tray!

**Tabs Tray** is an extension that helps you organize your browser tabs efficiently.

In a nutshell, Tabs Tray puts all your tabs on the screen instead of the cramped tab bar.

Here's a quick tutorial to get you started.

## Find and Pin the Tabs Tray Extension Button

After installation, you may need to find "Tabs Tray" in the extensions drop-down list, right-click it and select "Pin to Toolbar".

Once you have pinned Tabs Tray to the toolbar, you can always check how many tabs are open in the current browser window by looking at the number on our icon.

## Launch Tabs Tray

To activate Tabs Tray, simply click on the extension button, or press the keyboard shortcut (Alt+W by default).

You can then view and manage all the tabs that are currently open.

## Select Launch Mode

Including the default "Tab" mode, three launch modes are currently supported: 

- **Individual Tab**: Opens a new tab, using the full content area. (default)
- **Extension Button Popup**: Opens a popup window from the extension button.
- **In-Page Drawer**: Opens a drawer without leaving the activated tab. (Experimental)

> (*Note: The "In-Page Drawer" mode is not available on some restricted sites, such as `addons.mozilla.org`. The extension button will be dimmed on these sites.*)

You can change the launch mode and other settings later on the Options page. **Enjoy!**
