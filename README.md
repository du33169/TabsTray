# Tabs Tray

No more endless scrolling! Tabs Tray lays out all tabs on the screen, clear and organized. Now can fully utilize your big fantastic desktop monitor to manage them, supplement to that poor narrow tab bar or sidebar.

Tabs Tray is inspired by, and also aims to bring back the same experience of tab management on tablet browsers.
